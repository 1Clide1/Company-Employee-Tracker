## Description
  
This program runs through the terminal, it allows you to view a company in the sense that you can view all of the employees, what role/job title they have, what department they are in, their salary, and who their managers are. You can also add a new role, new department, and new employees through this program among other things. The idea is to use this app to track the company and the employees.

To install this project that way it will run, you first need to clone the repo, open your favorite ide of choice (mine is vscode), second open the employee-tracker.js in your inegrated terminal and lastly type node employee-tracker.js to run the program. You can also bypass an ide and just run the program through git bash. You just need to go to the folder that contains the program.

To use this program once it is ran, you just need to select the choices and depending on what choice you choose you would have to answer a series of questions. After you answer the questions the answer will automatically generate. If you don't need to answer any questions the result will still be automatically be generated for you. It's supposed to be simple and easy that way anyone can use the program.

This project was really hard in my opinion, I had a hard time with understanding sql but I feel like what I was able to accomplish was really amazing to me. I want to further learn sql because I feel like this language will really help me in the future. I used every online website I could to understand sql and I also tried my best to write down as many comments that I could that way I can reinforce what I have learned. I got a lot of help from previous stack overflow forums, w3schools, youtube, and whatever I could find that would help me understand sql. Thankfully I did find a lot and everything I found was super helpful. The only main issue I found was that I ran into an issue with my update function. I was able to trial and error my way through the other problematic functions until they were able to work. However, with the update function I was not able to have the same luck. I feel like there is probably a simple typo but at this current time I am not sure what I did wrong. Other than that everything else worked fine and I still feel like I accomplished a lot so I am still happy on what I was able to achieve.
